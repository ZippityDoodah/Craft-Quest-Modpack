# Craft-Quest-Modpack
Minecraft Modpack by Zippity

This is a Modpack I'm currently developing using many different Mods designed by great folks out there in the Minecraft Mod Community. Please be patient as I go through the development process and as changes I feel are ready for public viewing I will ensure they get uploaded here. When I have nailed down all the Mods to be included and ensure their stability in the pack I will post a list of Mods being included in this pack along with credit given to all the Mod authors.

The theme of this Modpack revolves around a Quest series designed to follow different crafting development paths along a almost RP style storyline. I do not plan to be too heavily restrictive with progression although there will be moments here and there where progression may be gated at certain levels of quest development, but as this ia a Work in Progress (WIP) that could change as I go through the setup process.

As I get more accomplished, contributors will be welcomed and I thank everyone along this path of Modpack development for their kindness and assistance. All contributors regardless of their level of assistance will be given full credit for their help in this process.
